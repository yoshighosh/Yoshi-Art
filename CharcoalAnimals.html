            <img src="Images/GarfieldBlackAndWhite.jpg" alt="">
            <p> &nbsp; My very first charcoal drawing was a picture of my cat Garfield. I drew this when I was around 11. This was the first drawing that I thought looked realistic and started my passion of charcoal</p>
            <img src="Images/RedTailedHawk.jpg" alt="" id="real_hawk">
            <p> &nbsp; This drawing shows a picture of a red tailed hawk. My inspiration for this piece was when I was outside in my garden and I spotted a beautiful hawk swooping down into my neighbors backyard.</p>
            <img src="Images/Flamingo.jpg" alt="">
            <p> &nbsp; For my 12th birthday I ended up going to the oakland zoo because of my obessesion with animals back then. At the very entrance they were so many exhibits but what caught my eye were the male flamigos and their mating dance.This inspired me to draw a gray charcoal flamigo when I got home.</p>
            <img src="Images/GraySquirrel.jpg" alt="">
            <p> &nbsp; I know most people in north america have seen some type of squirrel. It was a few daysw after I drew my flamigo that I was looking for some inspiration when my mom started complaining about the squirrels that were attacking the garden.</p>
