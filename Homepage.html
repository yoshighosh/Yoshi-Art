            <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
            
            <p>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Aroshi (Yoshi) Ghosh was born in San Jose, California and she's an Indian American. Her love for art started when she was in the middle of class and started doodling and one of her friends asked if they could buy her art. Once she discovered this paasion, she started spending every free moment drawing. Her porfolio ranges from political caricatures to realistic charcoal drawings with everything inbetween. Right now she is working caricatures and cartoons using alchol markers. She's looking forward to going to highschool next year and pursuing more advanced art courses.
